## Introduction

Welcome to the Volatility and Investor Behavior Study project. This research project explores the relationship between market volatility and investor behavior. It consists of two main components:

- **Investor Behavior Analysis**: This part of the project investigates the behavior of investors in response to various market conditions. We analyze factors like returns, cumulative returns, kurtosis, skewness, and economic indicators to understand how investors make decisions in the financial markets.

- **Volatility Measurement**: In this section, we focus on measuring and modeling market volatility. Our goal is to provide insights into the volatility of different stock markets using statistical techniques like ARCH and GARCH models.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Investor_Behavior_Notebook_1.ipynb**: This notebook covers the analysis of investor behavior, including returns, cumulative returns, kurtosis, skewness, and economic indicators.

2. **Investor_Behavior_Notebook_2.ipynb**: The second notebook continues the analysis of investor behavior and explores the construction and optimization of portfolios using various strategies.

3. **Volatility_Measurement_Notebook.ipynb**: In this notebook, we delve into measuring and modeling market volatility using ARCH and GARCH models.
